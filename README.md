# TMS9918-sprites
A selection of simple single colour 16x16 Sprites compatible with TMS9918 Video Processor.

## Summary
The Texas Instruments TMS9918 is one of the earliest if not the earliest video chip that could display "hardware" sprites, in addition to the more common text and general grid based bitmap graphics.  

The sprites were not large and colourful, in fact the largest a spite can be is 16x16 pixels with a single colour and transparency.  This repo contains examples of graphics which can be used in projects that use this chip.
