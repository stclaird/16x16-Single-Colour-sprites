# 16 x 16 Pixel Single Colour Sprites
A selection of simple single colour 16x16 Sprites.  This very limited sprite size and colour specification are compatible with very early graphics chips like the Texas Instruments TMS9918 Video Processor.

## Summary
The Texas Instruments TMS9918 is one of the earliest if not the earliest video chip that could display ["hardware" sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)), in addition to the more common text only display and general grid based bitmap graphics.  This chip was found in machines such as the TI-99/4(a), the MSX-1 as well as some early Sega Consoles.

The sprites were not large and colourful, in fact the largest a sprite can be is 16x16 pixels with a single colour and transparency.  This repo contains examples of graphics which can be included in projects that use this chip.
